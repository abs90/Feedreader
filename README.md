# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.

## What is this Project?

As part of the Udacity FEND, a crucial part of being a developer, I was tasked to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

As testing is a vital part of the development process, this was a very good exercise to practice test-driven development.

## Tests implemented

Test suite 1: RSS Feeds:

- Feeds are Defined
- Feed URL is not empty
- Feed names are not empty

Test suite 2: The Menu:

- The menu is hidden by default
- When clicked the menu changes visibility

Test suite 3: Initial Entries:

- Feed container has at least 1 entry

Test suite 4: New Feed Selection:

- Feed content changes when new feed is selected (i.e. every time we refresh or add a new feed)
